My name is Eduardo De La Rosa, but I prefer to go by Eddie, and I am an applied computer science major. Iâ€™m currently a third year student who just recently transitioned into applied from the regular computer science track as I felt it to be a better fit considering my career goals. I will be graduating in the spring of 2024 and plan to enter into the tech industry as a front-end developer. Outside of an academic environment I am interested in music and avidly play the piano. I am also into skateboarding, photography, and more often than not spend my free time reading popular and old novels!
